# Setting up model: 
#   Based on Burkner (2020), I believe the best way to analyze the tests
#   is with a graded response ordinal model.  We can try to fit a model 
#   with or without a guessing parameter.  This model can have user effects
#   and question covariates ( snake region or family). 

# Relabeling user and question
#   To make interpretation neater I recode user ID and question (filename) as integers 
#   We will use the standard names "id" and "item" for the user and question respectively.  This 
#   matches the terminology used in IRT.
